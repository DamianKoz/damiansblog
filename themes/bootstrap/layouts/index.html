      <h1>Hi, welcome to my blog!</h1>
      <p>
        This site will host my writing on applied philosophy, technology,
        self-education, science and pretty much anything that interests me.
      </p>
      <p>
        One topic that has intrigued me recently is how to deal with our modern,
        rapidly changing world and how to understand and thrive within complex
        systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        And since I am a big fan of applied knowledge, I will always try to keep
        everything discussed here applicable to everyday life.
      </p>
      <p>
        A little bit about myself: I recently graduated with my bachelor's
        degree in computer science and now I am working as a Fullstack-Developer
        at a german InsurTech-StartUp.
      </p>

      <p>Outside of work, I enjoy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Solving coding challenges in the form of competitive programming.
