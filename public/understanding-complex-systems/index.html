<p>I recently read a very interesting article by Nat Eliason called De-Atomization is the Secret to Happiness, which introduced me to the concept of a complex system, and even though he didn&rsquo;t call it a &ldquo;complex system&rdquo; I thought that this is just the right term.</p>
<p>Nat talked about (complex, social) activities, like a dinner with friends, and how we tend to break them down into smaller pieces, like just eating or just having fun with friends, which can lead to a loss of social benefits and ultimately, unhappiness. We often do this for the sake of productivity and efficiency, and stop having fun dinners with friends and instead opt to sit alone at our desks and drink our food in form of a Huel shake to not waste a single second.</p>
<p>It is difficult to summarize Nat’s article in one sentence, so I would suggest you to read it.</p>
<p>Anyway, his article made me think of other examples where we should leave systems as they are and not break them down for the sake of productivity or some other goal.</p>
<h1 id="foundation-chaos-theory">Foundation: Chaos Theory</h1>
<p>I will be using the term &ldquo;complexity&rdquo; or &ldquo;complex system&rdquo; quite frequently in this post. I took this term from Chaos Theory, so it might be helpful to take a brief look at chaos theory before diving into my definition.</p>
<p>Chaos Theory is a mathematical field that studies nonlinear systems, which don&rsquo;t always respond the same way to very similar inputs, making it challenging or even impossible to predict their behavior.</p>
<p>Imagine a toy car that moves further forward the harder you push. Nothing special, right? But a nonlinear toy car would sometimes move a little bit for a tiny push, and other times it might move a lot for another tiny push.</p>
<p>This makes it hard (or even impossible) to predict where the car will go to. And this might sound far-stretched, but this is more common than we think.</p>
<p>Nonlinear systems seem complex or maybe even random, since they are most often very sensitive to initial conditions, which means that a small change in the system will lead to a completely different outcome.</p>
<p>Chaos theory has many real-world applications, including weather forecasting, population dynamics, and the stock market.</p>
<p>In summary, Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the behavior of dynamic systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, and that can exhibit complex and seemingly random behavior.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s look at my definition of complexity.</p>
<h1 id="complexity">Complexity</h1>
<p>I will use the term &ldquo;complex system&rdquo; to describe a system, where individual components interact and influence each other. Changing one component through intervention can have multiple and often unpredictable consequences. Even if an intervention might seem small, it can lead to a completely different outcome for the system, due to its complexity.</p>
<p>These consequences are typically known as first-order, second-order, third-order effects, and so on; While first-order effects are intuitive and immediate, the higher ones are not and can be very hard to predict.</p>
<p>One example of first-order thinking is a manager tasked with cutting the costs in his department, and he decides to lay off several of his employees to cut costs. This may improve the short-term situation, but can lead to lower morale and decreased productivity in the long-term.</p>
<p>Problems arise if effects have consequences that are not immediate and not properly considered. We neglect second-order effects far too often.</p>
<p>When we talk about nutrition, we focus only on the food, or even more blatantly, on the individual nutrients. The issue is that we never take in just individual nutrients, and that they all affect each other.</p>
<p>If I drink green tea, it inhibits my iron absorption. Or if I&rsquo;m eating an unhealthy meal in a social setting where I&rsquo;m very happy, the induced happiness may outweigh the negative aspects of the meal.</p>
<p>This could be a reason for the (anecdotal) longevity of occasional drinkers because they might have such a good time with their friends while having a drink, that it lowers their stress levels and increases psychological well-being, and thereby outweighing the disadvantages of alcohol. This obviously doesn&rsquo;t mean that drinking alcohol is healthy, but rather shows the interplay of multiple factors determining an overall outcome in complex systems.</p>
<p>Likewise, education is a complex system. Focusing mainly on intellectual activities while neglecting proper physical activity can lead to unintended problems that could actually be avoided, such as decreased fine-motoric skills, reduced brain function, and a potentially shorter life span. While it may feel productive to spend more time studying than exercising, it could be more harmful in the long run if this leads to increased sickness and decreased overall productivity.</p>
<p>Dealing with the Corona pandemic was also a good example. Simple measures like wearing masks or getting vaccinated have clear and relatively predictable benefits with limited negative impacts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, lockdowns with their long periods of limited social interaction can have far-reaching consequences, including an impact on our physical and mental health, the education system, social skills, overall well-being, and the economy.</p>
<p>During the lockdowns, many children have been neglected due to online education. Privileged children were either tutored by parents who were able to work from home and had the technology explained to them by their parents and most importantly, they even had the necessary devices to properly participate in online classes.</p>
<p>Hopefully, these examples have shown what complex systems mean in this context: Anything that involves so much interconnectivity and complexity, that any action changing one part of the system will lead to very hard or impossible-to-predict consequences.</p>
<p>These systems tend to be organic, like the human body and mental health, or show similar properties to organic life or include social components, like the economy or the environment.</p>
<p>Basically, anything that involves humans and social interactions is predetermined to turn into a complex system, because human behavior is so complex that it is very hard to predict.</p>
<h1 id="stripping-down-complex-systems">Stripping down complex systems</h1>
<p>So, what happens, if we try to decompose and break down complex systems? Thoughtless intervention and the breaking down of complex systems can have unintended consequences and may result in the loss of important aspects that contribute to the overall function of the system.</p>
<p>We often do this for productivity reasons and in the example of a dinner with friends, breaking meals down into only their nutritional components eliminates the social and emotional benefits that come from spending time with others, laughing, and enjoying oneself.</p>
<p>Our extreme focus on productivity has broken this down to: “We only need the nutrients from food and everything else can be eliminated” which leads to products like Huel, an entire meal inside a bottle, which we gulp down alone at our desk. Sounds fun, right?</p>
<p>The problem with stripping away all the other elements of a nice dinner is that dinner is not just about the nutritional intake. It is about spending time together with friends and family. Enjoying ourselves, laughing, and releasing a bunch of feel-good hormones.</p>
<p>On a side note: This is also why I am skeptical about many nutritional studies. I am quite convinced that a semi-healthy dinner in good companionship is healthier in the long-term than drinking a Huel every day, which might provide all the necessary nutrients but lacks the other benefits of a good dinner.</p>
<h1 id="so-why-even-bother">So, why even bother?</h1>
<p>Why should we care about complex systems? After spending a lot of time with complex systems one might have a feeling of loss of control. If we cannot truly understand complex systems or easily intervene in one, then what&rsquo;s the point? Can’t we just accept that the world is too complex?</p>
<p>I think not. It is useful to learn about complex systems, to make better decisions. Humans are great at acting without 100% of the information, and we can use heuristics to estimate missing information.</p>
<p>We can use our knowledge about complex systems to improve our decision-making in these environments. Our actions might still be wrong, and we won’t have all the information, but a decision that is well thought through, which tries to consider possible side effects, is better than a purely naive one.</p>
<p>This knowledge teaches us humility. We should realize that we are often not as smart as we might think and everybody who claims to have understood financial markets, politics or any other complex systems, will be humbled be the knowledge gained about complexity.</p>
<p>Our modern world is a very complex place, and knowing this helps us approach problems in a more well-thought-through manner. In short, understanding complex systems leads to better decision-making and a deeper appreciation for the world around us.</p>
